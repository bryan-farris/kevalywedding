			<p>A short 14 years ago :) these two lovebirds fell head over heels for each other while watching "The Notebook" with friends...as most couples do...</p>

			<p>As all would agree, when Kevin and Ryan Gosling are side by side it's nearly impossible to tell who is who...naturally Aly could not resist!</p>
			
			<p>All kidding aside, we feel so lucky and even more excited to share this special day with all of you. Please visit the link below to reserve your hotel room if you'd like to kick off your boots at the end of the evening and crash comfortably at the Hampton Inn & Suites Chicago/Mt. ProspectÂ (in Randhurst) There will be transportation (to wedding location) available for guests staying at the hotel.</p>
			
			<p>The celebration will be held in the Grimm backyard.</p>
			
			<p>Big hugs and love,</p>
			
			<p>Aly and Kevin</p>
